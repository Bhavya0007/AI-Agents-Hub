## 🧠 Why This Exists

AI agents go beyond simple chat — they can:
- 🔍 Retrieve real-world data using web search APIs
- 🛠️ Use tools like weather lookup, translation, YouTube, and image search
- 🧭 Make decisions, summarize, plan, or even say *“I don’t know”* when needed

This repo lets you explore, combine, and evolve these patterns in one place.
