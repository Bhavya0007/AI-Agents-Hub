        "# AI Agent Travel Planning Project\n",
        "\n",
        "This project details an intelligent travel planning assistant built using [LangChain](https://python.langchain.com/) and custom tools. The agent leverages real-time data from various sources like the web, news, images, weather, Wikipedia, and YouTube to generate comprehensive, up-to-date travel itineraries.\n",
        "\n",
        "## Features\n",
        "\n",
        "* **Real-Time Web Search:** Finds transportation, hotels, and general information using the Google Serper API.\n",
        "* **News Monitoring:** Checks for recent safety issues or relevant news in the destination city.\n",
        "* **Weather Forecasts:** Provides accurate weather forecasts for your travel dates.\n",
        "* **Places & Attractions:** Lists popular places to visit, including ratings and addresses.\n",
        "* **Wikipedia Integration:** Fetches historical and descriptive information about destinations.\n",
        "* **Image & Video Search:** Finds relevant images and YouTube travel vlogs for visual inspiration.\n",
        "* **Custom Math Tools:** Includes basic arithmetic capabilities for calculations.\n",
        "* **Trip Summary:** Compiles all gathered findings into a user-friendly trip summary.\n",
        "\n",
        "## How It Works\n",
        "\n",
        "1.  **User Input:** You provide a travel query (e.g., \"Plan a 3-day trip from Pune to Mumbai by train. I am vegetarian.\").\n",
        "2.  **Agent Reasoning:** The agent follows a step-by-step plan, utilizing each tool as needed:\n",
        "    * Checks news for safety concerns.\n",
        "    * Retrieves the weather forecast.\n",
        "    * Searches for transportation and hotel options.\n",
        "    * Lists places of interest to visit.\n",
        "    * Fetches Wikipedia information, images, and videos.\n",
        "    * Summarizes the entire trip plan.\n",
        "3.  **Output:** Returns a detailed, actionable travel plan.\n",
        "\n",
        "## Technologies Used\n",
        "\n",
        "* **LangChain:** A framework for building language model-powered applications.\n",
        "* **Google Serper API:** Used for web, news, image, and place searches.\n",
        "* **Open-Meteo API:** Utilized for weather forecasts.\n",
        "* **Wikipedia API:** For accessing encyclopedic information.\n",
        "* **Youtube:** For finding relevant travel videos.\n",
        "* **Custom Python Tools:** Developed for specific formatting and calculation needs.\n",
        "\n",
        "## Setup\n",
        "\n",
        "1.  **Clone the repository** and install dependencies:\n",
